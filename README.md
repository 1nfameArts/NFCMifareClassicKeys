# NFC Key Dumps
Dump of Mifare classic keys to use within Flipper Zero. Not affiliated with flipper devices inc.

# Current available dumps (on this repository)
[TTC](https://oao-tts.ru/) [Card Key dump](https://github.com/1nfameArts/NFCMifareClassicKeys/blob/main/TTC.txt). Not everything could be bruteforced.

(Context: TTC is a russian public transport service in Tyumen Region which uses MF classic to authenticate)

[Keygen](https://github.com/1nfameArts/NFCMifareClassicKeys/blob/main/KeyGen.txt). Random assortment of letters and numbers. Unknown chance of card unlock. (but probably pretty high)

# Future plans
I am planning to add more keys for more parsing.

To be more specific, I am going to go key hunting.

This is going to be tough, considering that most of my nearby systems are utilizing UID to authenticate, and not the data sectors.

That's where YOU come in.

Collect tags and try to bruteforce them (Buy an NFC reader and install linux on a VM anywhere) and submit pull requests to make the repo BETTER.
